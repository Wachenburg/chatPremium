This is a project made in a group of four for our first semester college C++ class. Besides me, it is being worked by @Legal777, @DrgaEoBraia597 and @Lipe010.

The idea for this project is to create a message platform with JWT encoding, integrated mainly with a database and also some config files.

-Current task:
  *Create and test all the needed classes
-What we want to add: 
  *Integrate JWT for c++
  *Add a language option (portuguese, and english, maybe german)
  *Fast login (get username from last logged user)
  *Graphic interface + light and Dark mode
